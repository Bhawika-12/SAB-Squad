# Problem Statement
The major problem is faced by people who are suffering from chronic diseases, elderly people, and those who are physically disabled. These people depend on daily medicines to stay healthy and to manage their conditions. However, many of them forget to take their medicines on time because of weak memory, old age, stress, or physical difficulty. This is a common problem and happens in many households.

For long-term illnesses like diabetes, heart problems, blood pressure, and other serious conditions, medicines must be taken at fixed times every day. If the medicine is missed or taken late, it can reduce its effect and make the illness worse. Elderly people face this problem more often because memory loss increases with age. Physically disabled people may also struggle to follow their medicine routine without help.

Another major issue is that patients often forget whether they have already taken their medicine or not. This creates confusion and can lead to serious mistakes. Sometimes they skip a dose thinking they have already taken it. Other times, they take the same medicine again by mistake. Both situations can be harmful and may cause health problems.

Missing medicines regularly can slowly damage the patient’s health. Over time, this can lead to medical emergencies, hospital visits, or serious complications. Family members and caregivers are always worried because they cannot be present with the patient all the time. This increases stress for both the patient and their family.

Timely medication is very important for people who rely on medicines every day. Without proper support or reminders, these people remain at risk of health issues caused by missed or incorrect medicine doses. This shows the need for a simple and reliable way to help patients take their medicines correctly and on time.
